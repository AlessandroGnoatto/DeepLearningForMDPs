# DeepLearningForMDPs
Some deep learning-based algorithms have been introduced and theoretically studied in [DeepLearningForMDPs_theoreticalPart](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04300) to solve Markovian Decisions Processes (MDPs). The latter have been tested and compared on many numerical applications, and the results are available on [DeepLearningForMDPs_applicationsPart](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05916).

Some codes used for the tests presented in [DeepLearningForMDPs_applicationsPart](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05916) are available in this repertory: 
* slpde_ClassifHybrid.py is the code for the ClassifHybrid algorithm used on the Semi-Linear PDE example.
* sgm_ClassifHybrid.py is the code for the ClassifHybrid algorithm used on the Smart Grid Management example.
* ves_ClassifHybrid.py is the code for the ClassifHybrid algorithm used on the Valuation of Energy Storage example.
